How should be checked program which is counting words from input? What type of input data could make it easier to find potential errors?

We should check how output and how program reacts (errors?) for specific cases of input. For example:
    - escape characters are used (for example - /t should divide words)
    - digits and letters are mixed
    - special characters are used (for example ^%@)
    - newlines one after another
    - empty input
